1.	liquebase is used for versioning of database, its like git for dbms as you have to add, delete, update etc. tables and schema while developing.

2.	we can write liquibase scripts in xml,json,yaml and sql format.

3.	It supports code branching and merging.

4.	Working flow:-
	-It identify the database type from change log
	-then we have set of change sets(we can create or remove one or more change sets)
	-based on these change sets it creates sql file.
	
5.	If you have error in your change set, liquibase process will fail and you need to resolve issue.

6.	If you run liquibase for the first time, it will create two  files
		1- databasechangelog	-actual database scripts recides here
		2- databasechangeloglock	-it defines only one person at a time will change database scripts.
	-from next time it will only update these 2 files
