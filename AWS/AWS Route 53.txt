1.	• Route53 is a Managed DNS (Domain Name System)
	• DNS is a collection of rules and records which helps clients understand how to reach a server through URLs.
	• In AWS, the most common records are:
		• A: hostname to IPv4
		• AAAA: hostname to IPv6
		• CNAME: hostname to hostname
		• Alias: hostname to AWS resource.
	• Route53 can use:
		• public domain names you own (or buy)
			application1.mypublicdomain.com
		• private domain names that can be resolved by your instances in your VPCs.
			application1.company.internal
	• Route53 has advanced features such as:
		• Load balancing (through DNS – also called client load balancing)
		• Health checks (although limited…)
		• Routing policy: simple, failover, geolocation, latency, weighted, multi value
	• You pay $0.50 per month per hosted zone
	
2.	DNS Records TTL (Time to Live)
	• High TTL: (e.g. 24hr)
		• Less traffic on DNS
		• Possibly outdated records
	• Low TTL: (e.g 60 s)
		• More traffic on DNS
		• Records are outdated for less time
		• Easy to change records
	• TTL is mandatory for each DNS record
	
3.	CNAME vs Alias
	• AWS Resources (Load Balancer, CloudFront…) expose an AWS hostname:
		lb1-1234.us-east-2.elb.amazonaws.com and you want myapp.mydomain.com
	• CNAME(Canonical Name):
		• Points a hostname to any other hostname. (app.mydomain.com => blabla.anything.com)
		• ONLY FOR NON ROOT DOMAIN (aka. something.mydomain.com) not like mydomain.com which is root domain
	• Alias:
		• Points a hostname to an AWS Resource (app.mydomain.com => blabla.amazonaws.com)
		• Works for ROOT DOMAIN and NON ROOT DOMAIN (aka mydomain.com)
		• Free of charge
		• Native health check
		
4.	Simple Routing Policy
	• Maps a hostname to another hostname
	• Use when you need to redirect to a single resource
	• You can’t attach health checks to simple routing policy
	• If multiple values are returned, a random one is chosen by the client
	
5.	Weighted Routing Policy
	• Control the % of the requests that go to specific endpoint
	• Helpful to test 1% of traffic on new app version for example
	• Helpful to split traffic between two regions
	• Can be associated with Health Checks
	
6.	Latency Routing Policy
	• Redirect to the server that has the least latency close to us
	• Super helpful when latency of users is a priority
	• Latency is evaluated in terms of user to designated AWS Region
	• Germany may be directed to the US (if that’s the lowest latency)
	
7.	Health Checks
	• If an instance is unhealthy and health check fails then route 53 won't redirect to that instance anymore
	• Have X health checks failed => unhealthy (default 3)
	• After X health checks passed => health (default 3)
	• Default Health Check Interval: 30s (can set to 10s – higher cost)
	• About 15 health checkers will check the endpoint health
	• => one request every 2 seconds on average
	• Can have HTTP, TCP and HTTPS health checks (no SSL verification)
	• Possibility of integrating the health check with CloudWatch
	• Health checks can be linked to Route53 DNS queries!
	
8.	Failover Routing Policy
	• You need to set one primary instance linked to DNS and one secondary to same DNS.
	• Associate health check with primary(mandatory) and if primary health check in unhealthy then Route53 will route to secondary DNS.
	
9.	Geo Location Routing Policy
	• Different from Latency based!
	• This is routing based on user location
	• Here we specify: traffic from the UK should go to this specific IP
	• Should create a “default” policy (in case there’s no match on location)
	
10.	Multi Value Routing Policy
	• Use when routing traffic to multiple resources
	• Want to associate a Route 53 health checks with records
	• Up to 8 healthy records are returned for each Multi Value query
	• Multi Value is not a substitute for having an ELB
	
11.	Route53 as a Registrar
	• A domain name registrar is an organization that manages the reservation of Internet domain names
	• Famous names:
		• GoDaddy
		• Google Domains
		• Etc…
	• And also… Route53 (e.g. AWS)!
	• Domain Registrar != DNS
	
12.	3rd Party Registrar with AWS Route 53
	• If you buy your domain on 3rd party website, you can still use Route53.
		• 1) Create a Hosted Zone in Route 53
		• 2) Update NS Records on 3rd party website to use Route 53 name servers
