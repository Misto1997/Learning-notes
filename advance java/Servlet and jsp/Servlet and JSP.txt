1.	Servlet is a java file which takes request from client, process it and provide a required response.(a class extends httpservlet is called servlet).

2.	web container(apache,glashfish these are some web containers) is a helper application which gets 
	request from server and it have deployment descriptor (web.xml file or you can use annotation) which looks for corresponding servlet.
	
3.	Httpservletrequest and httpservletresponse object is created by your server you just need reference of it.

4.	we use request.getParameter("variable"); to fetch value by name and it returns a string, convert it using typecasting(ex. Integer.parseInt(req.getParameter())).
	and request.getAttribute("variable")(used in servlet side ex. session), it returns object, convert it using typecasting(ex. (int)session.getAttribute());
	
5.	PrintWriter out = response.getWriter() is used to print response in web page.

6.	get and post used in client side(jsp or html) while doGet and doPost used in server side(servlet) and these two called through service method only.

7.	RequestDispatcher is a interface so to get instance of it you need to use (RequestDispatcher rd= request.getRequestDispatcher();).

8.	request.setAttribute("variable",value); and request.getAttribute("variable"); (used when same request object is used)
	are methods of Httpservletrequest used to set and get values between diff. servlets apart from session management.
	
9.	RequestDispatcher used at server side mainly and it sends the same req. and res. object to another page(servlet) and 
	gets the result on the same page without user knowing that from which servlet output is coming. use of it is idle when servlet are from same website.
	
10.	sendRedirect() is a method of response object uses a new req. and res. object everytime it is called and user knows that from where the output 
	is coming as it redirects to that page and that page url is shown in url bar. use of it is idle when servlets are from diff. website.
	
11.	You need to use session management when using sendRedirect as it uses new req. object everytime so setAttribute wont work here.
	three technique for session management:-
	a.	Url rewriting:- is way to send some value in the url  and then fetch it using getParameter. ex:- response.sendRedirect("servletURL?val="+value);
	b.	HttpSession:- tomcat gives us a session we just need to get it using HttpSession. It is a interface we can get object using request.getSession();
					  and then use session.setAttribute("variable",value); and session.getAttribute("variable"); to use it.
	c.	Cookies:- Cookie is class used to store values and it is stored in your browser.You can store value using Cookie variable=new Cookie("name",string value);
				  and then you add it to your response object using response.addCookie(variable).
				  you can fetch value using Cookie variable[]=req.getCookies();
				  
12.	Using ServletContext you can specify some constant values at web.xml file using <context-param> tag and
	can use in any servlet(idle for multiple servlets shares common constant).
	
13. Using ServletConfig you can specify some constant values at web.mxl file inside servlet using <init-param> tag and can use it in that specific servlet.

14.	You can use Servlet Annotation to map your servlet with your page if you dont want to use web.xml file (ex. @WebServlet("/urlName") ).

15.	JSP(Java Server Pages) it used when you want to do server side programming(servlet) along with your front end designing(css,html) in a single page.

16.	JSP have implicit all objects provide by Tomcat to implement like request,response,PrintWriter,HttpSession etc.

17.	Whatever you write in JSP page gets converted into servlet class and then the same process. your demo.jsp names convert into class demo_jsp and your code 
	inside scriptlet tag goes inside service method.

18.	a.	we have scriptlet tag <%...%> to write code which goes inside service method.
	b.	we have declaration tag <%!...%> to declare variable or method which goes outside service method.
	c. 	we have expression tag <%=...%> to print something.
	d.	we have directive tag <%@page import="package name"...%> to import some packages. we have 3 types @page to import package,
		<%@include file="filename" %> to add another pages and <%@taglib uri="uri name" prefix="prefix name" %> to add external tags.
	
19.	Using JSP will take time as its get convert into servlet first for the first time so using servlet instead of writting code inside JSP is a better option.

20.	MVC(Model View Controller) Model(ex.-POJO) defines the structre of your application it is basically a object sent to view by controller, 
	view(ex.-JSP page) contains the layout to be shown to user and controller(ex.-servlets) contains data to be shown and controls like which
	view is to be shown to the user.
	
21.	Filter is a Interface, You can use filters for different servlets simultaniously to maintain log files,security etc. 
	they are plugins you can use them with any servlet. you need to chain filters if you are using multiple filter for single servlet.
