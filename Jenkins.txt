1.	Jenkins is a Java Application used for CI(Continuos Integration)/CD(Continues Delivery).

2.	It works well with shared repository like Github, bit bucket etc. 
		-	as soon as someone pushes the code to repository Jenkins triggers a build and notify the status of build.
		-	One can enable various steps post build like run unit tests or code quality checks and sends report back.

3.	by default Jenkins come with its own standalone servlet container i.e (Jetty/Winstone) but you can configure it with any servlet container like Tomcat, JBoss etc.

4. By default Jenkins stores details like logs,plugins,all configs, job details under .jenkins folder but you can change it.

5.	You can use Role based Authorization Strategy plugin to assign Roles to different users.

6.	you add git plugin and add repo url to jenkins with build commands to run your project with different run strategy.

7.	you can use CatLight software along with Jenkins to get all job related notification on your desktop.

8.	Jenkins helps in full CI/CD Pipeline(group of events/jobs chained together in sequence) setup. i.e Build -> Deploy -> Test -> Release.
	-	example: once code is pushed to GIT "build" job is triggered and once its successfull jar/ear/var file gets deployed via "deploy " jobs trigger to test env. and tests are been done using "test" jobs and once everything is fine "release" jobs are been triggered.

9.	JenkinsFile is a pipeline as a code where we write scripts to setup jenkins pipelines.
