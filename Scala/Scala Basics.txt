1.	Scala works on JVM same as Java so internal working is same.

2.	It is combination of both i.e OOP and functional programming.

3.	scala dont have premetive data type, all types are class type ex. Int is also a class in scala.

4.	you can declare variable using var or val. var is mutable while val is immutable it is constant.

5.	you can define function using def ex. def func(){}.

6.	here we dont have arithmetic operators, instead we have function that means here + is also a function.
	8+7 and 8.+(7) results into 15. here 8 is object, . is operator, + is function and 7 is parameter to function.
	object.function(parameter).

7.	In scala we have case class which is like a normal class which is immutable have some benifits like:-
		-gives a factory method with same class name and same parameter so that we can create object without new keyword.
		-by default it takes val as type for variable in contructor if we dont define.
		-it adds Default Implementation‚Äù to toString, hashCode and equals and copy methods.

8.	Unit type is like void when nothing is returned.

9.	here you can overload operator as mentioned those are functions only you can overload them.

10.	in order to handle concurrency in scala by default almost everything is immutable i.e Int , List, Array etc.

11.	like java have Object type as top data type in scala we have "Any" type if we dont define anything futher it have AnyVal
	and AnyRef.
	AnyVal- Integer,boolean,char
	AnyRef-	Collections,String,Classes
